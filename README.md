#      CSS Selectors
 CSS selectors are used to select the content you want to style elements according to its id,class,type,attribute etc.
 # There are several different types of selectors in CSS

        2. CSS Id selector
        3. CSS Class Selector
        4. CSS Universal Selector
        5. CSS attribute Selector

 # CSS Combinators
 A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

# There are four different combinators in CSS:
       1.descendant selector (space)
       2.child selector (>)
       3.adjacent sibling selector (+)
       4.general sibling selector (~)
